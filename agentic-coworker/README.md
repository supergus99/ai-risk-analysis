# Agentic Coworker — Governed AI Agents for Social and Enterprise

> Empower AI agents to work autonomously across your entire business ecosystem—from social platforms like LinkedIn, to productivity tools like Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) and GitHub, to enterprise systems like SAP and ServiceNow. Agents automatically acquire skills and integrate with any REST API, while enterprise governance ensures they have the right permissions, access the right tools, and operate within your security boundaries. Built for organizations that want powerful agents with human oversight.

## ✨ What Your Agents Can Do


### Agents Work Across Your Entire Business

- 🔌 **Connect to Any API Instantly** - Agents automatically acquire new skills from REST APIs using multiple sources: API documentation websites, OpenAPI specs, and Postman collections. They validate and test new capabilities before using them in production workflows.

- 🏢 **Understand Your Business Context** - Agents organize their capabilities by your business structure: Role → Domain → Capability → Skill → Tool. They know which tools to use for which job, matching their actions to your organization's responsibilities and workflows.

- 🔐 **Operate Securely Within Boundaries** - Agents authenticate using OAuth 2.0 across Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, ServiceNow, and more. Their credentials are encrypted (AES-256-GCM), automatically refreshed, and completely isolated per tenant. They never cross security boundaries.

- 👥 **Work Under Human Governance** - Agents operate with fine-grained permissions based on their assigned roles. They only access tools they're authorized to use, work within resource limits, and maintain audit trails of all actions. Humans stay in control through owner/member/viewer relationships.

### How Agents Evolve and Learn

1. **Acquire Skills** - Agents import new capabilities from various API formats, understand them through semantic metadata, and validate them with built-in testing before deployment.

2. **Organize Knowledge** - Agents structure their tools hierarchically by business domains, making intelligent decisions about which capabilities to use for each task.

3. **Execute Autonomously** - Agents run workflows across multiple services, manage OAuth credentials automatically, and operate at scale across isolated tenants.

### Agent Intelligence Features

- ✅ **Self-Testing Capabilities** - Agents validate their tools with sample data and schema verification before using them
- 🏗️ **Tenant-Aware Operations** - Agents maintain complete isolation of data, tools, and credentials across organizational boundaries
- 🔍 **Semantic Tool Discovery** - Agents find the right tools using vector embeddings and similarity matching
- 🔑 **Autonomous Credential Management** - Agents handle OAuth tokens, refresh cycles, and encryption automatically
- 🤝 **Human Collaboration** - Agents work with multiple humans in owner, member, or viewer capacities
- 📊 **Business Process Awareness** - Agents map their actions to business workflows and domain-specific metrics
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Multiple agents orchestrate together, each with specialized capabilities
- 🎯 **Standardized Communication** - Agents use Model Context Protocol (MCP) for consistent tool interaction
- 📈 **Knowledge Graph Navigation** - Agents leverage relationship mapping to understand complex connections
- 🚀 **Cloud-Native Deployment** - Agents run in containerized environments with automatic scaling
- 🔄 **Event-Driven Coordination** - Agents communicate and coordinate through real-time messaging

```

**Windows:**
```cmd
start.bat       # Start all services
cleanup.bat     # Stop and remove all volumes
```

### Managing Services

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart services
docker-compose restart

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild after changes
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Database Operations

```bash
# Create backup
docker exec agent-ops python -m agent_ops backup

# Restore from backup
docker exec agent-ops python -m agent_ops restore \
  --restore-from /app/data/backup_data/[backup-folder]

# Update credentials
docker exec agent-ops python -m agent_ops update
```

See [agent_ops/QUICK_REFERENCE.md](agent_ops/QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for detailed operations.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Services Won't Start

```bash
# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs for specific service
docker-compose logs [service-name]
```

### Reset Everything

```bash
# Stop and remove all containers and volumes
docker-compose down -v

# Start fresh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Verify Postgres is healthy
docker exec postgres psql -U user -d agent-studio -c "SELECT 1;"
```

### Keycloak SSL Errors

The platform auto-configures Keycloak on first start. If you encounter SSL errors:

```bash
docker exec keycloak /opt/keycloak/bin/kcadm.sh config credentials \
  --server http://localhost:8080 --realm master --user admin --password admin
docker exec keycloak /opt/keycloak/bin/kcadm.sh update realms/master -s sslRequired=none
```

### Port Conflicts

Edit `docker-compose.yml` to change host port mappings:

```yaml
ports:
  - "3001:3000"  # Changed from 3000:3000
```
