    Internal API services to support MCP (Model Context Protocol) services in agents.
    
    This API provides various support services including:
    - Authentication provider management
    - Email services
    - Sample data processing endpoints for testing and demonstration
    
    ## Authentication
    Most endpoints require Bearer token authentication. Include your token in the Authorization header:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer your_token_here
    ```
    
    ## Sample Endpoints
    The `/samples` endpoints demonstrate various data processing capabilities and serve as templates for integration testing.
